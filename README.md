## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build a simple recipe page that is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. The design required precise implementation of typography, layout, and spacing to match the provided mockups as closely as possible.

## My process
- I worked throught the HTML code first, then styled with CSS for Desktop, and finally for Modile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive design techniques (including media queries)
- VC Code
- Git Bash
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for typography

### What I learned

Responsive Design: This project reinforced my understanding of responsive design, particularly through the use of media queries to adjust layouts for different screen sizes. I learned how to create a layout that is both visually appealing and functional on desktop and mobile devices.

Git and GitHub: I expanded my knowledge of version control with Git. I practiced how to effectively use Git for tracking changes, including staging, committing, and pushing updates to a remote repository. I also gained confidence in using Git Bash as a command-line tool for managing my repository.

GitHub Pages: I discovered how to use GitHub Pages to deploy a live version of my project. This involved setting up a repository, pushing my changes, and configuring GitHub Pages to serve my HTML and CSS files. Understanding this process allowed me to see my project live on the web and share it with others.

Working with Git Bash: By using Git Bash, I familiarized myself with the command-line interface for interacting with Git. This included navigating directories, initializing a repository, connecting to a remote repository, and handling common Git tasks like merging, pulling, and pushing.


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to further explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts and continue improving my skills in creating more sophisticated and interactive web components.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - This is my go-to ressource! This was very helpful for understanding how to approach responsive design in CSS.
- ChatGPT - Immensely helpful to clarify, explain, fine tunen and debbug.
